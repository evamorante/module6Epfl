/**Logic errors

Unfortunately, there is no way to track these errors other than using your instinct. 
You can of course use the assumptions logging method (and you should!) but it also means
that you will need to be able to test the program with values for which you know what the answer will be.

A tip that I can give you and that is based on experience: whenever you work on a 
program for someone else, don't have the person only give you what the program should
do. Have the person also give you test values and their results so that you can test that everything works as expected.*/
